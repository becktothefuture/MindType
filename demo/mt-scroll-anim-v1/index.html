          Type at the speed of a thought.
        </h1>

        <h2 data-mt>
          Typing has always been mechanical. A precise sequence of keystrokes. A system that punishes the smallest slip with correction, backspace, distraction.
        </h2>

        <h2 data-mt>
          Mind⠶Type changes that. It is a layer beneath the keyboard. It listens to your natural rhythm, takes what muscle memory produces, and resolves it into the words you intended. Not after. Not later. As you type.
        </h2>

        <h2 data-mt>
          A dynamic band of text trails the cursor, alive and adaptive. Within that space, letters align, punctuation falls into place, sentences settle into coherence.
        </h2>

        <h2 data-mt>
          The process is faster than you can register. Below the threshold of awareness. Which means your focus never breaks, your attention never shifts. What appears on screen is what you meant to say.
        </h2>

        <h2 data-mt>
          All refinement happens locally. Nothing leaves your device. Secure fields are ignored and your attention is safeguarded.
        </h2>

        <h2 data-mt>
          For writers, it means continuity. For learners, confidence. For neurodivergent users: fewer breaks in working memory, more space for ideas.
        </h2>

        <h2 data-mt>
          Keep your words exactly as they are. Or shift them—into formal precision, lyrical cadence, sharper impact.
        </h2>

        <h2 data-mt>
          This is not spellcheck. Not an assistant. Not correction after the fact. It is a new mode of input. A system where typing and thinking converge.
        </h2>

        <h2 data-mt>
          Be first to experience the future of typing.
