# Launch Strategy & Success Metrics

_MindTyper Deep-Dive Questionnaire — Section 13 of 13_

**Progress: 8/8 questions (100%)**

This section defines MindTyper's launch strategy, success metrics, and post-launch optimization plans.

**200. Launch Sequence & Milestones?**
_Primer: Clarifies this decision and why it matters._
→ Your answer:

- Alpha (2–3 weeks): 50 users (writers/knowledge workers). Goals: install success ≥ 95%, first suggestion within 2 min for ≥ 90%.
- Closed Beta (6–8 weeks): 100–300 invites in tranches. Goals: p95 latency within budget on M‑series/Intel; undo rate ≤ 0.5%; NPS ≥ 40.
- Public Beta (4–6 weeks): Product Hunt + targeted communities. Goals: 2–3K signups, conversion ≥ 8%, crash‑free ≥ 99.8%.
- 1.0 Launch: press/creator reviews; Mac App Store listing (if ready). Goals: 4.5+ rating, refund ≤ 2%, support SLA ≤ 48h.
- Post‑launch (ongoing): monthly minors; quarterly majors; staged rollouts 1%→10%→100% with health gates.

**201. Launch Success Criteria?**
_Primer: Clarifies this decision and why it matters._
→ Your answer:

- Week 1: 1K installs, activation ≥ 70% (first suggestion applied), p95 latency on device within target, crash‑free ≥ 99.5%.
- Week 4: 500+ DAU, free→Plus conversion ≥ 10%, NPS ≥ 50 (writers/knowledge workers), App Store ≥ 4.5.
- Month 3: 3–5K paying users or run‑rate ARR ≥ target; churn ≤ 6% monthly; refunds ≤ 2%.
- Quality: undo rate ≤ 0.5% of edits; privacy complaints = 0; support SLA met 95% of the time.

---

**202. User Onboarding & First Experience?**
_Primer: Clarifies this decision and why it matters._
→ Your answer:

- 90‑second guided setup: permissions, quick demo, privacy reminder (“input never leaves device”).
- Aha in 2 minutes: type in a test field; show one accepted correction and one suggestion dismissal + undo.
- Progressive discovery: per‑app scopes, quiet hours, and aggressiveness sliders introduced contextually.
- Safety nets: universal undo, safe defaults in sensitive apps, easy pause.

---

**203. Performance Monitoring & Optimization?**
_Primer: Clarifies this decision and why it matters._
→ Your answer:

- Real‑time: opt‑in, content‑free telemetry of latency histograms, CPU/RAM envelopes, crash reports.
- Dashboards: release health, device‑class breakdowns; alerts on SLA breaches (latency, crash‑free, memory).
- Experiments: feature‑flagged heuristics; A/B small, reversible; roll back on > 5% regression.
- Cadence: weekly perf review; targeted optimizations for outlier device classes.

---

**204. Feedback Collection & Iteration?**
_Primer: Clarifies this decision and why it matters._
→ Your answer:

- Channels: in‑app feedback sheet, support email, lightweight community forum, occasional 15‑min user calls.
- Triage: tag by area; prioritize P0/P1 issues, then high‑impact UX papercuts.
- Loop: publish release notes; acknowledge top feedback; ship 2‑week improvements.
- Respect: no nagging; prompts are optional; never collect content.

---

**205. Growth Strategy & Optimization?**
_Primer: Clarifies this decision and why it matters._
→ Your answer:

- Product‑led: superior latency, privacy stance, and system‑wide coverage drive word‑of‑mouth.
- Referral: +1 month Plus for referrer, +14 days for referee (caps apply).
- Content: honest posts (privacy, latency, design); creator reviews; tasteful Apple Search Ads on exact‑match terms.
- Partnerships: macOS/writing media; education programs; privacy org reviews.

---

**206. Long-term Vision & Roadmap?**
_Primer: Clarifies this decision and why it matters._
→ Your answer:

- Year 1: macOS excellence; language packs; personalization polish; accessibility and design refinement.
- Year 2: optional iOS keyboard; Windows shell reusing Rust core; team licensing at scale.
- Year 3: deeper personalization, richer per‑app behaviors, expanded locales.
- Always: privacy uncompromised; input never leaves device.

---

**207. Risk Mitigation & Contingency Planning?**
_Primer: Clarifies this decision and why it matters._
→ Your answer:

- Competitive response: hold niche (noise→clean text, on‑device); focus on feel/latency/design; ship fast via flags.
- Technical setbacks: rollback path for models/updates; keep last‑known‑good; hotfix playbook.
- Demand spikes: invite caps; queue; pause paid ads; prioritize support.
- Funding runway: lean ops; prioritize Plus annuals; stage headcount after PMF.

- Clarifier 13.4.a — Product Hunt Launch Checklist
  - Assets: hero video (before/after typing), 5–7 screenshots (light/dark), GIF of Caps‑Lock modal, privacy one‑pager.
  - Listing: clear tagline, concise maker’s comment, feature bullets, pricing card, FAQ (privacy, latency, offline).
  - Timing: launch early Tue/Wed; prepare day‑of schedule (founder replies, maker’s update at +6h, thank‑you at +20h).
  - Prep: press kit link, support coverage for 48h, track questions; no growth hacks.
