Introduction

Mind::Type is an always‑on, on‑device text engine that transforms noisy keystrokes into clear, confident prose in real time. By tapping into a local language model and a refined diffusion algorithm, it respects the user’s voice and keeps them in flow. Unlike traditional grammar checkers, Mind::Type is a subtle tapestry that weaves clarity behind the caret without interrupting.

Problem & Audience
• Writers and knowledge workers lose flow correcting typos and minor errors.
• Non‑native speakers desire clarity without losing their personal tone.
• Anyone who types on a Mac – from short search terms to long essays – deserves frictionless, clean output.

Value Proposition

Mind::Type acts as a magic tapestry: it continuously cleans and optimises text behind the caret while preserving your unique voice. It does not predict or insert text ahead of you; it simply transforms what you have already committed. This approach avoids the intrusive experience of suggestion pop‑ups and integrates seamlessly alongside tools like Grammarly.

Vision & Principles
• Always present, never intrusive – boots with the OS and activates instantly when a text cursor appears.
• Caret‑safe editing – edits occur strictly behind the caret, never to the right.
• Live diffusion – continuous refinement as you type, with deeper sweeps on pause.
• Voice preservation – neutral mode preserves style; a formality slider lets you dial formal↔friendly.
• Confidence gating – edits only occur when model confidence exceeds a threshold, which rises with distance.
• Privacy by design – everything runs on device; no content leaves your machine.
• Invisible yet tangible UX – subtle visual cues and animated symbols convey progress without distraction.

Did you know? The simple rule of never editing in front of the caret builds immense user trust. Users are more willing to let an AI assist when they know it cannot hijack their future words.

Goals & Success Metrics
• Deliver on‑device LM inference with <15 ms p95 latency on Apple Silicon and <30 ms on Intel Macs.
• Maintain typical memory footprint under 150 MB (including the model) with a 200 MB cap.
• Achieve a false‑positive undo rate below 0.5%.
• Secure ≥70% activation within one week of installation.
• Reach a Net Promoter Score ≥50 among writers.

Feature Overview
• Real‑time diffusion: continuous micro‑refinements during typing, with deeper sweeps on ~500 ms pause.
• Near‑field awareness: the engine scans the full text field but only acts within a configurable window behind the caret.
• Dynamic confidence gating: thresholds rise with distance; user can adjust overall confidence sensitivity.
• Undo independence: diffusion edits never enter the host undo stack. A time‑based grouping lets users step back through clusters of edits as a safety net.
• Animated corrections: a custom symbol (e.g. animated dots inspired by Braille) marks text segments being refined. The animation progresses backwards from the caret, then resolves into clean text.
• Formality control: neutral (default), friendly, or formal – modulates tone while preserving meaning.
• A11y‑compliant UI: reduced‑motion alternatives, screen‑reader announcements, and subtle validation bands.
• Settings pane: adjust confidence threshold, band style, near‑field scope, and compatibility options.

Technical Considerations

Mind::Type relies on a local language model (initially Qwen2.5‑0.5B‑Instruct with quantised weights) accessed via WebGPU. The scheduler monitors typing rate to time micro‑refinements, ensuring the app stays ahead of user perception. Confidence thresholds adapt with user patterns: the more the user accepts corrections, the bolder Mind::Type becomes.

Undo behaviour is decoupled: diffusion edits are not pushed onto the host undo stack, so users can undo their own input without fighting the system. A separate safety mechanism lets users revert batches of applied refinements in temporal chunks, should they wish to backtrack.

Risks & Mitigations
• Latency on older hardware may lag; mitigate via smaller models and adaptive fallback reducing sweep depth.
• Over‑correction could erode trust; mitigate with conservative gating and adaptive thresholds that respond to undo behaviour.
• Complex UI cues might confuse users; mitigate through thorough testing and opt‑in animations for reduced‑motion preferences.
• Competition with existing tools (e.g. Grammarly) could conflict; mitigate by integrating at the committed text layer and offering compatibility toggles.

Rollout & Success Plan

Mind::Type will launch first as a closed beta for a cohort of writers and designers, focusing on long‑form and knowledge‑work scenarios. Feedback will refine the confidence model, visual cues, and settings. Subsequent phases will broaden to general Mac users, emphasising performance across hardware generations. Success will be measured through activation, NPS, and tangible reductions in editing effort as reported by participants.
