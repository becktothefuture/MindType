## Purpose (a new way to type)

- Type forward; the line behind you gets better. That’s the shift.
- Fewer micro‑stops, more finished thoughts. Your voice, just clearer.
- Help lives where you write—quiet, instant, and private on your device.

## Brand claim (primary)

- Type forward. The line behind you gets better.

## Vision pitch (v0.2)

### Simple

I’m building a smart typing system for your computer, tablet, and phone that quietly fixes mistakes and smooths your words as you write — for anyone who types, especially neurodivergent thinkers, who want a faster, more natural way to express themselves.

### A world beyond backspaces

Think about the last time your fingers couldn’t keep up with your thoughts. You pause mid‑sentence, fix typos, lose your train of thought. What if you didn’t have to? Great stories start with purpose, so let’s begin there.

### Why it exists

Mind::Type was created because we believe typing should feel as natural as thinking. People connect with the why behind a product, not just the what. Our purpose is to remove friction and make writing calmer and more human‑centred, whether you’re a professional seeking flow or someone who finds conventional typing a challenge.

### What it does

Mind::Type is a quiet layer between your keyboard and your screen. It turns noisy keystrokes into clean, well‑formed sentences that still sound like you. The aim is not to be noticed, but to free you to focus on ideas. True simplicity comes from clarifying the purpose of a product, and here that purpose is to let your voice come through without distraction.

### How it works

Behind the calm interface is an AI diffusion model for text. As you type, it refines rough input into clear language on the fly. It’s like ten‑finger typing for everyone: instant, non‑intrusive and respectful of your system’s performance. Secure fields such as passwords remain untouched, processing happens locally or via encrypted channels, and you can adjust tone if you choose.

### Addressing concerns

An effective pitch anticipates objections. Mind::Type doesn’t spy on you; it doesn’t save your data or slow you down. It’s not another assistant; it’s a utility that works quietly in the background. Everything runs under your control, with privacy and security baked in.

### A new form of interaction

By eliminating friction, we’re not just fixing typos. We’re creating a new way to interact with your machine, one where the keyboard becomes an extension of your thoughts. When technology works intuitively it feels almost magical. That’s the experience Mind::Type aims to deliver.

## Pitch (three lengths)

### Short

- A calm writing companion that improves the last few words you typed— as you type—without getting in the way.

### Medium

- Mind::Type makes typing feel like thinking. While you move forward, it quietly improves the line just behind your cursor so your thoughts land cleanly—fewer typos, tidier sentences, calmer edits. No pop‑ups, no tab‑hopping, and your text stays on your device.

### Long

- Mind::Type removes human–computer friction so your attention stays on the idea. It keeps a short strip of text behind your cursor “active,” gently cleaning and clarifying it while you type. Older text is safe; nothing jumps; control is always yours. It works right where you write, keeps your text on your device, and adapts to your computer so it always feels smooth.

## Main selling points

- Stay in flow: fewer stops, more momentum.
- Clearer text, same voice.
- No pop‑ups, no switching apps.
- Private by default (on‑device).
- Works wherever you type.

## How it works (plain)

- We keep a tiny area behind your cursor active; only it can change.
- Small, on‑device models and rules make light, reversible edits.
- No interruptions—just type forward.

## Ten ways to explain Mind::Type (beginner → expert)

1. Beginner (what it does)

- Mind::Type quietly cleans and improves what you just typed so it reads right, without pop‑ups or pauses.

2. Beginner+ (how it feels)

- It keeps a small area behind your cursor “active” and steadily polishes it while you keep typing.

3. Intermediate (why it's different)

- Instead of interrupting you, it streams fixes into a short active region behind the caret, so your flow never breaks.

4. Intermediate+ (what you see)

- A subtle shimmer shows where the system is refining text—the active region—without jumping lines or modal dialogs.

5. Technical (how it works)

- On‑device language models and rules propose tiny edits; only the active region can change, older text is locked.

6. Technical+ (safety)

- A diffusion controller schedules merges with confidence gating and instant rollback if the caret re‑enters the region.

7. Advanced (algorithms)

- Streaming token suggestions are diffed and applied under a bounded delay; newline‑safe ranges prevent layout shifts.

8. Advanced+ (performance)

- Device‑tier policies (WebGPU / WASM / CPU) tune cadence, token caps, and active‑region size to match your hardware.

9. Expert (architecture)

- A Rust‑first orchestrator exposes a C/WASM ABI; hosts render `mindtype:activeRegion` and `highlight` events for visuals.

10. Expert+ (signal)

- By constraining edits to near‑field context, it increases text SNR—turning input noise into signal in real time.

## Brand claim (technical variant)

- The on‑device, real‑time human–computer writing aid that turns messy typing into clear text.

## Product descriptions (technical)

### Short

- Real‑time, on‑device refinement of the text just behind your caret—no pop‑ups, no slowdown.

### Medium

- Mind::Type is a live human–computer interaction utility for text. As you
  type, a small active region just behind your cursor receives
  streaming, on‑device improvements—grammar, clarity, tone—without
  interrupts or mode switches. It’s reversible, private by default, and
  tuned to your hardware for a calm, coherent writing loop.

- Mind::Type eliminates human–computer friction so you can think at full
  bandwidth. It pairs your forward intent with a constrained, on‑device
  model that edits only where it’s safe: a short, visible active region
  behind the caret. A Rust‑first core orchestrates streaming merges with
  confidence gating, reversible rollbacks, and newline‑safe ranges, so
  layout never jumps and rhythm never breaks. Hosts (web, macOS,
  Windows) render understated cues from events like `mindtype:activeRegion`
  and `highlight`, while device‑tier policies adapt cadence and token
  budgets across WebGPU, WASM, or CPU. The result is a live, closed‑loop
  writing aid: you move forward; Mind::Type quietly lifts the text behind
  you.

## Glossary (plain words)

- Human–computer interaction: how you and your computer work together while you type.
- Noise to signal: turning messy, half‑formed words into clear, readable sentences.

## Words to avoid in public copy

- HMI/HCI, SNR, tokens, WebGPU/WASM/ABI (use “on‑device” and “adapts to your computer”).

## Positioning (Noise → Signal, HMI)

- Human‑machine interaction utility that turns typing into a closed‑loop
  system: human intent in, on‑device signal out.

## Audiences and why they care

- Writers & knowledge workers: stay in flow; get clarity without context
  switching.
- Engineers & technical users: on‑device by default, deterministic
  merges, privacy, and portable APIs.
- Executives & operators: more signal per minute—cleaner docs, fewer
  revisions, calmer teams.
- Students & learners: immediate guidance that preserves your voice; less
  second‑guessing.
- Neurodiverse users: fewer micro‑interruptions; reduced working‑memory
  tax; smoother momentum.
- Security‑sensitive orgs: no text leaves the machine unless explicitly
  opted‑in.

## The three whys (asked backwards)

1. Why Mind::Type? To remove typing friction so progress feels
   continuous.
2. Why remove friction? To protect attention and working memory—the
   scarce resource.
3. Why protect attention? Because better attention yields better
   thinking, which compounds into clearer communication and better
   outcomes.

## Skeptic’s FAQ (convince the cynic)

- Isn’t this just autocorrect? No—suggestions stream into a bounded
  active region; semantics first, no modal jumps.
- Will it slow me down? No—device‑tier policies keep cadence smooth;
  edits wait behind you, never ahead of you.
- What about privacy? On‑device by default; remote models require
  explicit, per‑session opt‑in.
- Will it change my voice? You set intensity and domains; the system
  favors clarity over style unless asked.
- Why not Grammarly? Different goal: Mind::Type is live HMI for thinking
  while typing, not a post‑hoc checker.

## Reasons to believe (proof points)

- On‑device LM path with Transformers.js; Rust orchestrator; no outbound
  text by default.
- Active‑region constraint: safe, newline‑aware ranges prevent layout
  shifts and surprises.
- Confidence gating + rollback: merges are reversible the instant you
  need control.
- Portable interfaces: C/WASM ABI for native hosts; events for web;
  consistent feel across devices.
