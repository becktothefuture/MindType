# Mind::Type — Brand Style Guide & Manifesto

For navigation, see the live master guide: `guide/brand-style-guide.md`.

## Preface (Audience & Intent)

This document consolidates the written style guide and brand manifesto for
Mind::Type. It is intended for an average tech consumer in 2025–2026 and
establishes a baseline for a refined art direction. The theme is a “quiet
evolution of typing.” The brand is professional and minimalist — tools, not
toys — with an open‑source spirit of collaboration. Elements from
typography to imagery and motion ensure consistency and clarity.

## Manifesto & Vision (Summary)

Typing should be as seamless and quietly intuitive as thinking. Tools, not 
toys. Open‑source at heart — collaborative, transparent, inclusive. By 2026, 
Mind::Type is the everyday typing companion.

### Brand Manifesto & Vision

Typing should be as seamless and quietly intuitive as thinking. In a world
where digital communication is constant, Mind::Type represents a calm
revolution — a shift that improves the typing experience without fanfare or
fuss, empowering users to express themselves effortlessly.

We believe in tools, not toys. We craft technology that serves the user’s
mind, augmenting thoughts instead of distracting from them. Mind::Type
exists to gently evolve the way we type — making it faster, smarter, and
more comfortable, all while staying in the background. Like a natural
conversation, typing through Mind::Type flows with minimal friction.

We are open‑source at heart — a community‑driven approach where
transparency, collaboration, and collective innovation shape the product.
This openness is identity, not just a development model. Mind::Type invites
everyone to participate in its evolution, ensuring that the tool grows to
meet real needs of everyday tech users. By 2026 and beyond, our goal is for
Mind::Type to be the typing companion that anyone — not just power users —
can adopt instantly and feel right at home.

Our tone is humble, optimistic, and inclusive. We champion the idea that
high‑tech can be quietly powerful — enhancing daily life in subtle ways
without overwhelming complexity. We focus on clarity and utility, avoiding
jargon, and emphasizing real benefits such as comfort, speed, and ease. The
best technology feels almost invisible — it just works.

### Logo & Identity

Brand Name: Always “Mind::Type” with a double colon; capital M and T; no
spaces. The punctuation reflects a link between mind and typing.

Logo Design: Primary logo is a wordmark set in Geist Sans. Minimalistic and
text‑based by intent. A simple logomark may be developed later; the wordmark
remains the core identifier. The ® symbol may be used in formal contexts.

Logo Usage Guidelines:

- Clear Space: At least the height of the “M” around the wordmark.
- Minimum Size: ≥ 24px height on screen or 0.25in (6mm) in print.
- Color Versions: Black on light; white on dark; prioritize contrast over
  photography or color fields.
- Don’ts: Never alter font, aspect ratio, punctuation; avoid effects or
  recoloring beyond the approved palette; do not enclose in boxes.

### Typography

Primary Typeface — Geist Sans: clean, geometric, precise, Swiss‑influenced;
legible for headlines, body, UI labels.

Weights/Styles: Light–Bold range; Regular (400) for body; Bold/Medium for
headings; italics sparingly.

Usage: All headings in Geist Sans (Bold/Medium); body text in Regular; scales
from footnote to display sizes.

Secondary Typeface — Geist Mono: for code, shortcuts, technical contexts;
harmonizes with Geist Sans.

Fallbacks: System sans (Helvetica/Arial/sans‑serif) and standard monospace
(Menlo/Consolas/monospace) when custom fonts are unavailable.

Styling: Line height ≥ 1.4; left‑align body; center headlines selectively;
sentence case; reserve `::` motif for graphics.

### Color Palette

Primary Accent — Tranquil Teal `#3CC5CC` (placeholder family if refined).

Neutrals — White `#FFFFFF`, Almost‑white `#F5F5F5`, Charcoal `#111111`,
Black `#000000` (with appropriate inversions for dark mode). Mid‑grays
provide hierarchy.

Secondary Accent — Soft Rose `#FF6B6B` (optional) for error/highlight use;
minimal application.

Usage: Prefer neutral backgrounds; use teal for interaction/highlight;
avoid large teal fields; use gradients/glow subtly; ensure WCAG AA
contrast; document HEX/RGB values consistently.

### Imagery & Photography

Style: Minimalist, focused, soft diffused light, muted tones; occasional
black‑and‑white with subtle teal tie‑in.

Subject Matter: Real users, real moments; diverse; concentration and ease;
avoid staged corporate tropes.

Graphic Elements: Simple line‑art/outline illustrations; minimal color;
avoid cartoons.

Guidelines: Maintain legibility over images; license properly; ensure a
cohesive calm mood throughout.

### Iconography & Graphics

Thin line icons; monochrome by default; teal for active states; pair with
text labels; use decorative graphics sparingly.

### Motion & Interaction

Purposeful animations only; typical 150–300ms; soft ease‑in‑out; fades and
subtle slides; no bounce/elastic. Suggestions fade near the caret; accept
with a brief underline/glow; dialogs subtly rise/fade; success draws a
checkmark (~200ms). Defaults quiet; allow optional themes for advanced
users.

### Voice & Tone

Knowledgeable yet humble, friendly yet factual. Marketing: inspirational and
grounded. In‑app/UI: concise and helpful (e.g., “Press ::space to accept
suggestion”). Docs/community: conversational; emojis sparingly. Taglines:
“The Quiet Evolution of Typing.” and “Tools, Not Toys.”

### Usage Examples & Applications

Website Home: Clean layout; white wordmark over calm photography; tagline in
Geist Sans Light; teal CTA with soft hover; bold headings; line icons; direct
voice.

Product Interface: Dark default; off‑white text; ghosted/underlined teal
suggestions; gentle confirmation; simple settings; Geist Mono for code.

Social: Templates with teal/neutral backgrounds, wordmark, concise headline,
subtle `::` motif; humble captions that thank community.

Print/PDF: Cover with wordmark/tagline; pages for logo, type, colors,
imagery, motion, voice; swatches include HEX/RGB.

### Conclusion

Modern, minimal, and meaningful. Cohesive identity for 2025/2026: trustworthy
and understated. We uphold “tools, not toys” while delivering a natural,
inclusive evolution of typing.
