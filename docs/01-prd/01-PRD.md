# Mind⠶Flow: Revolutionary Typing Intelligence

## Executive Summary

Mind⠶Flow transforms typing from a mechanical skill into **fluid expression of thought**. Through our revolutionary **Correction Marker** system and **Burst-Pause-Correct** methodology, users achieve thought-speed typing with unprecedented accuracy and flow state preservation.

**Core Innovation**: The Correction Marker—an intelligent visual worker that travels through text, applying corrections behind the cursor while users maintain unbroken typing rhythm.

**Target Impact**: 3× effective WPM increase, 95%+ semantic accuracy, with users reporting "typing at the speed of thought."
## The Seven Revolutionary Scenarios

## The Correction Marker System

### Revolutionary Paradigm: Burst-Pause-Correct
**Muscle Memory Training**: Users develop unconscious rhythm:
1. **Burst Phase**: Rapid, uninhibited typing (trust the system)
2. **Pause Recognition**: Natural breathing moment (0.5-2 seconds)
3. **Correction Anticipation**: Subconscious expectation of refinement
4. **Flow Resumption**: Seamless continuation with enhanced confidence

### Two-Mode Operation

#### Listening Mode: The Digital Pulse
- **Visual**: Hypnotic braille symbol rotation (⠂ → ⠄ → ⠆ → ⠠ → ⠢ → ⠤ → ⠦ → ⠰ → ⠲ → ⠴ → ⠶)
- **Behavior**: Marker holds position at last correction point, pulsing with anticipation
- **Timing**: 200ms per symbol, 2.4-second complete cycle
- **Purpose**: Visual feedback that system is actively listening

#### Correction Mode: The Intelligent Worker
- **Trigger**: User pause >500ms
- **Motion**: Accelerates from waiting position toward cursor
- **Speed Adaptation**:
  - Noise corrections: 50ms/word (simple typos)
  - Context analysis: 150ms/word (grammar/flow)
  - Tone processing: 300ms/word (style refinement)
- **Visual**: Dynamic braille patterns indicating processing complexity

### Visual Experience
- **Whoosh Effect**: Marker flows like liquid intelligence with trailing effect
- **Processing Indicators**: Different braille patterns for correction types
- **Wake Effect**: Corrected words briefly highlight with 85% opacity fade
- **Accessibility**: High contrast, reduced-motion compliance, screen reader integration

## Core Technical Requirements

### Performance Targets
- **Latency**: p95 ≤ 15ms (WebGPU), ≤ 30ms (WASM/CPU)
- **Memory**: ≤150MB typical, ≤200MB maximum

### Safety & Privacy
- **Caret-Safe Guarantee**: No corrections at/after cursor position
- **On-Device Processing**: Default local-only, optional encrypted remote
- **Secure Context Detection**: Disabled in password fields, IME composition
- **Privacy**: No user text persistence, session-only opt-ins

### Three-Stage Pipeline
1. **Noise Transformer**: Immediate typo fixes (sub-millisecond)
2. **Context Transformer**: Grammar and coherence (English-only, LM-powered)
3. **Tone Transformer**: Optional style adjustment (None/Casual/Professional)

### Device Tier Optimization
- **WebGPU**: 48 token limit, fastest processing
- **WASM**: 24 token limit, balanced performance
- **CPU**: 16 token limit, graceful degradation

### Primary KPIs
