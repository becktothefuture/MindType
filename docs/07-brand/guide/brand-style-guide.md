## Introduction

Mind::Type is the quiet evolution of typing — tools, not toys. The brand
expresses clarity without spectacle, a bridge from mind → type. This master
document introduces principles and points to focused references for design,
product, and communication.

## TL;DR principles

- Clarity over spectacle
- Calm utility; minimal by default
- Open‑source spirit: transparent, collaborative, inclusive
- Accessibility and legibility are non‑negotiable
- Motion is purposeful and subtle

## How to use this guide

1. Read the manifesto to internalize intent.
2. Apply logo, type, and color rules in UI and comms.
3. Match imagery, icons, and motion to the brand mood.
4. Write in the brand voice; validate with examples.

## Folder structure

Brand docs organized into three subfolders for clarity:

```
docs/
  brand/
    README.md                ← redirect/index
    mindtype_brand_book.pdf
    assets/                  ← tokens, svg, exports
    guide/                   ← master and overviews
      brand-style-guide.md   ← master (start here)
      brand-style-guide-print.md
      moodboard.md
      brand-book.md
    specs/                   ← detailed rules
      manifesto.md
      logo-identity.md
      typography.md
      colors.md
      imagery.md
      iconography.md
      motion.md
      voice-tone.md
      usage-examples.md
```

This keeps depth shallow (≤ 2 levels) and subfolder count to three.

## Governance & versioning

This is a living guide. Propose changes via PR with rationale and before/after
examples. Maintain accessibility, contrast, and cross‑links. Tag releases in
sync with product milestones.
