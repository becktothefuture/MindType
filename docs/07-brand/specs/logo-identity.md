## Brand name

Always write the name as “MindType” — double colon, capital M and T,
no spaces: `MindType`. Do not alter capitalization or punctuation.

### The name (essence)

MindType is the moment between thought and text — a direct, deliberate
link from mental intent to written clarity. The double colon is the bridge,
the pause, the transfer. It speaks without shouting, reveals without
intrusion, and defines without spectacle.

## Logo design

Primary logo: wordmark “MindType” set in Geist Sans. The typography
conveys the brand. A future logomark may emerge (e.g., abstract key or
dialogue form), but the wordmark is the core identifier. The ® symbol may
appear in formal contexts.

## Usage guidelines

- **Clear space**: Keep free space around the wordmark equal to the height
  of the “M”.
- **Minimum size**: Not smaller than 24px height on screen or 0.25in (6mm)
  in print.
- **Color**: Single‑color usage preferred. Black on light, white on dark.
  Choose the version with best contrast over imagery.
- **Don’ts**: Never stretch, distort, restyle, enclose, recolor beyond
  approved palette, or add effects.

## Double colon motif

`::` is our bridge symbol — mind → type. Use sparingly as an accent in
graphics, not in running body copy.

### Symbolism

- **Bridge Between States** — transformation: mind → type, thought → form
- **Precision Mark** — from systems language where `::` scopes the specific
- **Pause Before Clarity** — a quiet breath reflecting presence without
  intrusion
- **Minimalist Distinction** — rare yet recognisable; stands out through
  understatement

### Psychological and visual impact

- **Memorable by Simplicity** — clean geometry of two equal points
- **Calm Symmetry** — balanced spacing signals stability and focus
- **Flow Representation** — passage of thought into words; our role is
  invisible, supportive
