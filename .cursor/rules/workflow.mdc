# Cursor Workflow Rules

This file tells Cursor how to behave and what steps to follow when working on the MindTyper project.

### Core Workflow

1.  **Task Identification**: Start by reading `docs/implementation.md` to identify the next priority task.
2.  **Context Review**: Before coding, consult:
    *   `context/glossary.md` for domain-specific terminology.
    *   `context/system_principles.md` for behavioral guidelines.
    *   `docs/project_structure.md` for architectural patterns.
3.  **File Setup**: Open or create the target file(s). Ensure the standard file header from `.cursor/rules/comment_style.mdc` is present.
4.  **External Libraries**: If using an external library, use **Context7** to fetch documentation for the exact version specified in `package.json`.
5.  **Implementation**: Generate code and corresponding tests.
6.  **Self-Correction**: Review generated code against the guidelines in `context/system_principles.md`.
7.  **Commit**: Commit changes with a message formatted as `[FT-ID] short summary`.

### MCP Registration (Cursor understands this block)

```json
{
  "mcpServers": [
    { "name": "context7", "command": "npx", "args": ["-y", "@upstash/context7-mcp"] }
  ]
}
```

### General Behavior

-   Prioritize user experience and performance.
-   Maintain consistency with existing patterns.
-   Document all significant changes.
-   Test thoroughly before committing.
