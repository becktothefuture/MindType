## The Correction Marker System

### Revolutionary Visual Paradigm
The **Correction Marker** is the core innovation that transforms typing from a mechanical task into cognitive augmentation. It serves as an intelligent visual worker that travels through text, applying corrections behind the cursor while users maintain unbroken typing rhythm.

### Two-Mode Operation

#### Listening Mode: The Digital Pulse
- **Visual**: Hypnotic braille symbol rotation (⠂ → ⠄ → ⠆ → ⠠ → ⠢ → ⠤ → ⠦ → ⠰ → ⠲ → ⠴ → ⠶)
- **Behavior**: Marker holds position at last correction point, pulsing with anticipation
- **Timing**: 200ms per symbol, 2.4-second complete cycle
- **Purpose**: Visual feedback that system is actively listening

#### Correction Mode: The Intelligent Worker
- **Trigger**: User pause >500ms
- **Motion**: Accelerates from waiting position toward cursor
- **Speed Adaptation**:
  - Noise corrections: 50ms/word (simple typos)
  - Context analysis: 150ms/word (grammar/flow)
  - Tone processing: 300ms/word (style refinement)
- **Visual**: Dynamic braille patterns indicating processing complexity

### Visual Experience
- **Whoosh Effect**: Marker flows like liquid intelligence with trailing effect
- **Processing Indicators**: Different braille patterns for correction types
- **Wake Effect**: Corrected words briefly highlight with 85% opacity fade
- **Accessibility**: High contrast, reduced-motion compliance, screen reader integration

### Technical Implementation
```typescript
interface CorrectionMarker {
  mode: 'listening' | 'correcting' | 'idle';
  position: number;
  targetPosition: number;
  animationState: BrailleSymbol;
  processingIntensity: 'light' | 'medium' | 'heavy';
}

// Braille symbol animation sequences
const LISTENING_SEQUENCE = ['⠂', '⠄', '⠆', '⠠', '⠢', '⠤', '⠦', '⠰', '⠲', '⠴', '⠶'];
const CORRECTING_PATTERNS = {
  noise: ['⠁', '⠂', '⠄', '⠈'],
  context: ['⠃', '⠆', '⠌'],
  tone: ['⠷', '⠿', '⠷']
};
```

---

## System Principles

### 1. Burst-Pause-Correct Rhythm
**Core Innovation**: Train users in natural typing rhythm where bursts of rapid input are followed by intelligent correction during natural pauses.

**Behavior**: 
- **Burst Phase**: Correction Marker holds position, pulsing in listening mode
- **Pause Recognition**: 500ms trigger activates correction mode
- **Correction Phase**: Marker travels through text, applying refinements
- **Flow Resumption**: Seamless return to burst typing

### 2. Correction Marker as Cognitive Partner
**Innovation**: Visual representation of AI intelligence working alongside human creativity.

**Behavior**:
- **Listening Mode**: Hypnotic braille pulse
- **Correction Mode**: Purposeful travel with speed adaptation based on processing complexity
- **Processing Indicators**: Different braille patterns for noise/context/tone corrections
- **Accessibility**: High contrast, reduced-motion compliance, screen reader integration

### 3. Scenario-Driven Intelligence
**Philosophy**: One size fits none—Mind⠶Flow adapts to specific user contexts and needs.

**Behavior**:
- **Academic Mode**: Scientific terminology, transposition priority, privacy-first
- **Multilingual Mode**: Cross-language error detection, cultural context preservation
- **Velocity Mode**: Phonetic shorthand, trust-based interface, legal terminology
- **Data Mode**: Custom dialect understanding, domain-specific expansion
- **Creative Mode**: Voice preservation, narrative coherence, flow enhancement
- **Professional Mode**: Tone consistency, business terminology, polished output
- **Accessibility Mode**: Screen reader optimization, silent corrections, high contrast

### 4. Caret-Safe Guarantee
**Absolute Rule**: No correction ever occurs at or after the cursor position.

**Behavior**:
- Active region limited to text behind caret (default 20 words)
- If cursor moves into correction zone, correction is immediately cancelled
- Safety validation before every edit operation
- Graceful degradation when safety constraints conflict with corrections

### 5. Privacy-First Architecture
**Philosophy**: User text is sacred—protect it with on-device processing by default.

**Behavior**:
- Default: All processing happens locally using WebGPU/WASM language models
- Optional: Encrypted remote processing with explicit per-session opt-in
- No user text persistence—only settings and preferences stored
- Secure context detection—disabled in password fields and IME composition

### 6. Device-Tier Adaptive Performance
**Philosophy**: Meet every device where it is—from high-end MacBook Pro to older hardware.

**Behavior**:
- **WebGPU Tier**: 15ms latency, 48 token limit, 60 FPS marker animation
- **WASM Tier**: 25ms latency, 24 token limit, 30 FPS marker animation  
- **CPU Tier**: 30ms latency, 16 token limit, 15 FPS marker animation
- Graceful degradation without feature loss

### 7. Fail-Soft Reliability
**Philosophy**: Any error should degrade gracefully, never block the user's typing flow.

**Behavior**:
- Timeouts cancel work and defer until next pause
- Missing local models → rules-only mode with setup guidance
- GPU unavailable → WASM fallback → CPU fallback
- Network errors → local-only operation

## Developer Guides

### Quick Start
1. Install toolchain
   - Node (pnpm), Rust, wasm-pack (for WASM builds), Playwright optional for e2e
2. Install deps: `pnpm install`
3. Run unit tests: `pnpm test`
4. Run quality gates: `pnpm typecheck && pnpm lint && pnpm format:check && pnpm test`
5. Explore tasks: open `docs/02-implementation/02-Implementation.md`

### Web Demo: Build and Run
1. Install tools (once): Rust toolchain, `wasm-pack`, Node, pnpm
2. From repo root, build the WASM package and the demo:
   - With `just`: `just build-web`
   - Or manually:
     - `wasm-pack build crates/core-rs --target web --out-dir bindings/wasm/pkg`
     - `pnpm --prefix web-demo install`
3. Run: `pnpm --prefix web-demo dev` → open the printed URL
4. Type a sentence and watch the active region trail behind your cursor; pause to see diffusion catch up.

### Development Workflow
- Follow `.cursor/rules/workflow.mdc` when planning and executing tasks.
- Scripts
  - `pnpm typecheck`: strict TS compile (no emit)
  - `pnpm lint`: ESLint (flat config) for TS
  - `pnpm format`: Prettier write
  - `pnpm format:check`: Prettier check
  - `pnpm test`: Vitest unit tests (scoped to `tests/**`)
- Optional: `just test-all` for broader matrix including Rust/e2e, if you use `just`.

### How Rust and TypeScript Work Together
- We compile the Rust crate to WASM and import it in the web demo as a normal package. The demo calls Rust functions directly.
- Rust provides speed and safety for fragmenting, merging, and timing.
- TypeScript/React provides rapid UI development and ecosystem tooling.
- Where Swift fits (mac app): The macOS app UI will be Swift/SwiftUI calling the same Rust core via FFI (native interface).

## Architectural Decision Records

### ADR-0002: Caret-Safe Diffs
**Status**: Accepted  
**Context**: Ensuring user trust and preventing text changes under cursor  
**Decision**: Implement absolute guarantee that no correction occurs at or after cursor position  
**Consequences**: 
- Active region limited to text behind caret (default 20 words)
- If cursor moves into correction zone, correction is immediately cancelled
- Safety validation before every edit operation
- Graceful degradation when safety constraints conflict with corrections

### ADR-0003: Architecture Constraints
**Status**: Accepted  
**Context**: Privacy-first design and performance requirements  
**Decision**: Implement privacy-first architecture with device-tier adaptive performance  
**Consequences**:
- Default: All processing happens locally using WebGPU/WASM language models
- Optional: Encrypted remote processing with explicit per-session opt-in
- No user text persistence—only settings and preferences stored
- Device-tier policies (WebGPU/WASM/CPU) tune cadence, token caps, and active-region size

### ADR-0005: Rust-First Orchestrator
**Status**: Accepted  
**Context**: Performance and safety requirements for core correction logic  
**Decision**: Implement Rust-first orchestrator for all correction logic and caret-safe operations  
**Consequences**:
- Rust core handles all performance-critical paths
- TypeScript UI handles rendering and user interaction
- WASM bridge enables cross-platform deployment
- Consistent behavior across web and native platforms

## Glossary & Terminology

### Core Concepts
- **Correction Marker**: Revolutionary visual system showing AI intelligence working alongside human creativity
- **Burst-Pause-Correct**: Natural typing rhythm where rapid bursts are followed by intelligent correction
- **Active Region**: Small neighborhood behind the caret (20 words) used for safe corrections
- **Listening Mode**: Correction Marker pulses with hypnotic braille animation while user types
- **Correction Mode**: Marker travels through text applying corrections with speed adaptation
- **Velocity Mode**: Revolutionary speed enhancement enabling 180+ WPM typing
- **Thought-Speed Typing**: Cognitive augmentation where users operate at the speed of neural firing
- **Seven Scenarios**: Revolutionary usage patterns from academic to speed typing to data analysis

### Technical Terms
- **Rust crate**: A Rust library/package. Our core logic is in `crates/core-rs`.
- **TypeScript (TS) core**: Lightweight glue in `core/`, `engines/`, and `utils/` that orchestrates typing events and rules.
- **WASM (WebAssembly)**: Lets Rust run in the browser. We compile Rust to a `.wasm` file and import it from TS.
- **wasm-bindgen**: Rust tooling that makes Rust functions callable from JS/TS.
- **Fragment extractor**: Finds the last finished sentence near the end of your text so we only correct complete thoughts.
- **Merger**: Combines incoming tokens into text. Today it appends words; later it will apply precise diffs.
- **Stub token stream**: A fake "stream of words" used to test our pipeline without a real network.
- **In-memory logger**: Collects logs in Rust and exposes them to the web demo.

### Brand Terms
- **Mind⠶Flow**: The revolutionary typing intelligence system (public-facing name)
- **Noise → Signal**: Turning messy, half-formed words into clear, readable sentences
- **Human-computer interaction**: How you and your computer work together while you type
- **Cognitive prosthetic**: Extending human capability at the intersection of thought and text

## Conclusion

Mind⠶Flow represents a revolutionary transformation in how humans interact with text. By combining the **Correction Marker** visual system with **Burst-Pause-Correct** methodology, we enable **thought-speed typing** across seven distinct scenarios, from academic excellence to speed mastery.

This comprehensive documentation serves as the ultimate source of truth for all stakeholders—from developers implementing the system to users experiencing the revolutionary transformation of typing from mechanical skill to fluid expression of thought.

The system's success is measured not by technical complexity, but by user transformation: enabling everyone to type at the speed of thought while preserving authorship, privacy, and flow state.

**Mind⠶Flow doesn't just correct typing—it unlocks human potential at the intersection of thought and text.**
