# Input Normalization & Output Behavior

_MindTyper Deep-Dive Questionnaire — Section 6 of 16_

**Progress: 36/36 questions answered (100%)**

This section covers advanced text processing, normalization rules, and detailed output behavior for edge cases.

---

**89. Should MindTyper let users export or import their tone model between devices?**
_Primer: Clarifies this decision and why it matters._
→ Your answer:

**Answer:** Yes—MindTyper will sync the user's tone model securely via the cloud, so the personalization travels seamlessly across devices using the same account. There's no need for manual export/import. It just works.

Local models can continue to adapt independently, and updates will merge with the cloud profile when connected.

---

**90. Should users be able to export or delete their data (e.g. tone model, typing stats)?**
_Primer: Clarifies this decision and why it matters._
→ Your answer:

**Answer:** Yes—MindTyper will follow strong privacy principles. Users can delete all personal data (including tone models and telemetry) from their account. Exporting may be optional later, but deletion is a must.

Data will be clearly scoped: MindTyper will only store what's necessary for core experience personalization, and users will have control over it.

---

**91. Should MindTyper offer insights or dashboards about a user's tone, speed, or typing behavior?**
_Primer: Clarifies this decision and why it matters._
→ Your answer:

**Answer:** Yes, but lightly. MindTyper can surface simple, celebratory metrics—like typing speed improvements or tone balance—as part of onboarding or milestones.

No full dashboards or analytics. Just meaningful, affirming touchpoints that reinforce progress—never judgment. A minimal stats interface will be available in settings showing typing accuracy improvements, speed gains over time, and proficiency tiers.

---

**92. Should users be able to manually label their own tone (e.g. "formal," "casual," "persuasive")?**
_Primer: Clarifies this decision and why it matters._
→ Your answer:

**Answer:** No—not through a big manual menu. MindTyper should infer tone automatically, and only offer a light-touch way to influence tone, like holding a modifier key to temporarily adjust sentiment or style, as previously described.

---

**93. Should MindTyper ever nudge users toward changing their tone (e.g. "Consider making this sound more confident")?**
_Primer: Clarifies this decision and why it matters._
→ Your answer:

**Answer:** No—MindTyper will never prompt or nudge users about tone changes. It's not here to critique or coach writing. Its job is to amplify clarity and correctness based on what the user is already expressing—not to editorialize.

Tone is inferred, not judged. Nudging would break the product's promise of subtlety and flow.

---

**94. Should MindTyper allow users to bookmark or save favorite writing samples to "teach" their tone?**
_Primer: Clarifies this decision and why it matters._
→ Your answer:

**Answer:** Not in the core MVP. MindTyper learns passively from how users naturally type. Manually saving samples introduces complexity and friction that go against the product's seamless philosophy.

This might be explored in future iterations for advanced users, but it's not necessary upfront.

---

**95. Should MindTyper suggest synonyms or more powerful word choices?**
_Primer: Clarifies this decision and why it matters._
→ Your answer:

**Answer:** No—MindTyper is not a writing assistant or style enhancer. It's a noise reducer, not a language rewriter.

Suggesting synonyms would risk changing meaning or tone, which is outside its scope. The user's voice stays central—MindTyper supports it, not substitutes it.

---

**96. Should MindTyper let users switch between multiple tone profiles (e.g. one for work, one for personal)?**
_Primer: Clarifies this decision and why it matters._
→ Your answer:

**Answer:** No—MindTyper should maintain a single adaptive tone model per user account. The tone shifts naturally based on context and input. Managing separate tone profiles adds friction and breaks the flow.

Tone will adapt fluidly, just like a person does across different apps or writing styles—without needing the user to toggle anything.

---

**97. Should MindTyper support fine-tuning for niche domains (e.g. legal writing, medical, creative fiction)?**
_Primer: Clarifies this decision and why it matters._
→ Your answer:

**Answer:** Not in the MVP. Domain-specific fine-tuning may be useful in the future, but MindTyper's early focus is on universal typing comfort and noise reduction. Overfitting to narrow styles risks breaking the core simplicity.

If introduced later, it will be done transparently and lightly, always enhancing—not reshaping—the user's voice.

---

**98. Should MindTyper allow developers to plug in their own language models or tone definitions?**
_Primer: Clarifies this decision and why it matters._
→ Your answer:

**Answer:** No—MindTyper is not a developer tool or open platform. Custom language models would compromise the product's consistency and low-friction design.

Third-party extensibility may be considered in the far future, but not at the cost of simplicity, privacy, or user experience.

---

**99. Should MindTyper let users define their own rules (e.g. always replace "utilize" with "use")?**
_Primer: Clarifies this decision and why it matters._
→ Your answer:

**Answer:** No—MindTyper won't include manual rule editing. The experience should feel magical and adaptive—not like configuring a rules engine.

It will learn passively from user behavior. If a user consistently rewrites something, MindTyper can infer that over time—but there's no need for explicit if-this-then-that logic.

---

**100. Should MindTyper distinguish between personal vs professional writing styles automatically?**
_Primer: Clarifies this decision and why it matters._
→ Your answer:

**Answer:** Yes—but softly. MindTyper will infer shifts in formality or tone based on writing behavior and context (e.g. app type, punctuation habits, word choice). It won't ask users to label content or switch modes.

The system adjusts its correction rhythm to match the user's natural style, whether it leans casual or professional—without judgment.

---

**101. Should MindTyper allow light tone tweaking (e.g. "more warm," "more neutral") via a modifier key or gesture?**
_Primer: Clarifies this decision and why it matters._
→ Your answer:

**Answer:** Yes—this builds on what you already described. Holding a specific key (like Caps Lock) for a few seconds could reveal a small, elegant tone selector next to the cursor. This lets users make real-time micro-adjustments without breaking flow.

It's optional, subtle, and designed to feel native and magical—no complex UI, just graceful control.

---

**102. Should MindTyper surface sentiment analysis (e.g. "this text sounds negative") to the user?**
_Primer: Clarifies this decision and why it matters._
→ Your answer:

**Answer:** No—MindTyper may internally recognize sentiment to guide subtle tone alignment, but it will never surface sentiment scores or judgments to the user.

It's not a feedback tool. It's an invisible amplifier—helping users express their intent, not interpreting or grading it.

---

**103. Should MindTyper support multilingual typing within the same sentence or document (e.g. typing English + Spanish)?**
_Primer: Clarifies this decision and why it matters._
→ Your answer:

**Answer:** Yes—MindTyper will seamlessly support multilingual typing. If the user switches languages mid-sentence or mid-document, the system will detect that through context and adjust dynamically.

It will prioritize accuracy and flow, only switching language models when there's clear contextual evidence, never just on a single word guess. Everything remains on-device where possible, respecting user privacy and performance.

---

**104. Should MindTyper allow users to type phonetically and have it corrected to proper spelling (e.g. "definitlee" → "definitely")?**
_Primer: Clarifies this decision and why it matters._
→ Your answer:

**Answer:** Yes—this is a core part of the noise-to-clean-text pipeline. MindTyper will automatically correct phonetic approximations to standard spellings, especially when the user clearly intends a specific word.

But it will respect informal, stylized, or intentional variations when context suggests they're purposeful. This correction is real-time and seamless, without interrupting the user.

---

**105. Should MindTyper preserve regional spelling preferences (e.g. "colour" vs "color")?**
_Primer: Clarifies this decision and why it matters._
→ Your answer:

**Answer:** Yes—MindTyper will honor the user's regional spelling preferences, either inferred from system settings (e.g. UK vs US English) or set explicitly during onboarding.

Once established, these preferences are preserved across devices and corrections adapt accordingly.

---

**106. Should MindTyper support code-aware correction (e.g. don't "fix" syntax or variable names)?**
_Primer: Clarifies this decision and why it matters._
→ Your answer:

**Answer:** Yes—MindTyper will recognize when code is being typed and completely disable correction within code blocks or clearly technical contexts. Syntax, variable names, indentation—none of it should be touched.

It may optionally reformat pasted code slightly for legibility (e.g. spacing), but it will never rewrite or correct keywords, as even small changes could break functionality.

---

**107. Should MindTyper handle emojis or emotive symbols differently?**
_Primer: Clarifies this decision and why it matters._
→ Your answer:

**Answer:** Yes—emojis will be left completely untouched. MindTyper will not attempt to correct, replace, or interpret them. They are an intentional part of user expression and not part of the noise-to-signal pipeline.

We may expand emoji behaviors later (like placement or spacing), but in the MVP they are passed through exactly as typed.

---

**108. Should MindTyper adjust its behavior based on time of day, device state, or user context?**
_Primer: Clarifies this decision and why it matters._
→ Your answer:

**Answer:** No—MindTyper should maintain consistent behavior regardless of external context like time of day. Context should come from the text and tone being typed, not from ambient factors.

The only exception is power-saving behavior when battery is critically low, where some features may reduce processing to preserve device performance.

---

**109. Should MindTyper try to correct inconsistent formatting (e.g. mixing "email" and "e-mail")?**
_Primer: Clarifies this decision and why it matters._
→ Your answer:

**Answer:** Yes—but only when it's clearly unintentional and the correction brings clarity. MindTyper will softly normalize common inconsistencies—like "email" vs "e-mail," or "startup" vs "start-up"—but only when there's high contextual certainty and consistency improves flow.

It respects the user's voice and choices—so if they use both forms for a reason (like quoting different sources), MindTyper will learn and leave them alone.

---

**110. Should MindTyper correct words based on surrounding punctuation or formatting? (e.g. "hell o." → "hello.")?**
_Primer: Clarifies this decision and why it matters._
→ Your answer:

**Answer:** Yes—MindTyper will use surrounding punctuation and sentence structure to guide corrections. If a space appears to split a word unintentionally (like "hell o."), and the punctuation suggests the user meant "hello," it will smartly correct it.

However, if that space was intentional for stylization or rhythm, the system will respect it—especially in informal or creative tone modes.

This reinforces the idea that MindTyper is not just spellcheck—it's intent-aware.

---

**111. Should MindTyper treat text typed in ALL CAPS differently?**
_Primer: Clarifies this decision and why it matters._
→ Your answer:

**Answer:** Yes—ALL CAPS will be treated as an intentional tone or emphasis signal. MindTyper will preserve all-caps usage when it clearly conveys emotion (like "I SAID NO") or standard conventions (like acronyms or headers).

However, if ALL CAPS appears by accident—like from a stuck Caps Lock—it may offer subtle behind-the-scenes correction if the pattern is clearly unintentional.

Overall, MindTyper will default to leaving it untouched, unless confidence is extremely high that it was a mistake.

---

**112. Should MindTyper preserve or correct regional keyboard quirks (e.g. straight quotes vs curly quotes)?**
_Primer: Clarifies this decision and why it matters._
→ Your answer:

**Answer:** Yes—MindTyper will preserve or gently normalize formatting quirks based on the user's regional keyboard layout, OS settings, and usage patterns.

For example, it might convert straight quotes to curly quotes only if the user consistently types in a style or context that benefits from that polish—like formal writing or publishing workflows.

Otherwise, it defaults to preserving the user's input style, especially in casual or code-related contexts. Clean, but never intrusive.

---

**113. Should MindTyper attempt to reflow or reshape paragraph breaks (e.g. merge single-line breaks into paragraphs)?**
_Primer: Clarifies this decision and why it matters._
→ Your answer:

**Answer:** Yes—but only with clear contextual cues. MindTyper can gently reflow line breaks when they interrupt natural sentence or paragraph structure—especially if they appear to be accidental (like a single Return key press mid-sentence).

That said, if the user consistently types in short bursts or uses line breaks for rhythm (e.g. messaging apps, poetry), the system will respect that style and leave it untouched.

Formatting changes are always tone-aware and never applied mid-input, only as part of the denoising pass.

---

**114. Should MindTyper autocorrect contractions (e.g. "youre" → "you're")?**
_Primer: Clarifies this decision and why it matters._
→ Your answer:

**Answer:** Yes—MindTyper will autocorrect contractions when the intent is obvious and the correction adds clarity without altering tone.

So "youre" becomes "you're," but if the user is writing super casually (like texting-style shorthand), it may leave it as-is depending on the selected or inferred tone.

MindTyper always aims to respect natural rhythm and personal style—it only cleans up when confidence is high that it improves the message.

---

**115. Should MindTyper correct casual contractions or shorthand (e.g. "gonna" → "going to")?**
_Primer: Clarifies this decision and why it matters._
→ Your answer:

**Answer:** No—MindTyper will preserve casual contractions like "gonna," "wanna," or "lemme" if they match the tone of the surrounding text.

It will only suggest or auto-correct to more formal versions if the user is clearly writing in a formal or professional tone, based on context or their tone profile.

This keeps the voice authentic and user-led—MindTyper elevates clarity without sanding off personality.

---

**116. Should MindTyper correct dialect-specific spellings or grammar (e.g. "ain't," "y'all")?**
_Primer: Clarifies this decision and why it matters._
→ Your answer:

**Answer:** No—MindTyper will respect dialect-specific grammar and vocabulary as long as they're used consistently and clearly match the user's tone.

Words like "ain't," "y'all," or regional phrasing (like "might could" in Southern U.S. English) won't be corrected unless the user is clearly aiming for a more formal or neutral voice.

MindTyper supports expression—not erasure. It adapts to users, not the other way around.

---

**117. Should MindTyper adapt to the user's preferred punctuation style (e.g. Oxford comma, em-dash vs. en-dash)?**
_Primer: Clarifies this decision and why it matters._
→ Your answer:

**Answer:** Yes—MindTyper will adapt to the user's preferred punctuation habits over time, including things like:

- Use or omission of the Oxford comma
- Preference for em-dashes, en-dashes, or simple hyphens
- Whether they use single or double quotation marks, etc.

It will learn from real usage and reinforce consistency without overriding the user's voice. These preferences live in the background, but can be nudged manually via the tone modifier if needed.

---

**118. Should MindTyper adapt to how the user formats dates, times, or measurements?**
_Primer: Clarifies this decision and why it matters._
→ Your answer:

**Answer:** Yes—MindTyper will observe and adapt to how each user formats dates, times, and measurements. Whether they type "5 August 2025" or "08/05/25," "2:30 PM" or "14:30," or use metric vs imperial units—it'll quietly follow their lead.

This personalization ensures clarity and cultural alignment, without enforcing a single standard. Where ambiguity arises, MindTyper will favor contextual consistency and regional defaults.

---

**119. Should MindTyper preserve spacing and formatting in copied or pasted text?**
_Primer: Clarifies this decision and why it matters._
→ Your answer:

**Answer:** Yes—MindTyper will preserve the original formatting and spacing of pasted text by default, especially for structured content like code, lists, or pre-formatted paragraphs.

It may lightly clean up obvious errors—like extra spaces or broken characters—but it won't apply corrections or reflow unless it's clearly unintentional and harmless.

The assumption is: if a user pasted it, they likely meant to keep it as-is.

---

**120. Should MindTyper treat numbers and symbols (e.g. %, $, €, #) differently depending on context?**
_Primer: Clarifies this decision and why it matters._
→ Your answer:

**Answer:** Yes—MindTyper will interpret numbers and symbols contextually. For example:

- "$10" stays as-is in pricing contexts
- "#1" remains untouched if it's a ranking or label
- "10 %" would be corrected to "10%" in a numerical context
- Spacing around symbols will be cleaned up where it improves readability

It won't change or interpret symbols unless there's high confidence it improves clarity without altering meaning. Context and consistency guide everything.

---

**121. Should MindTyper adjust spelling based on the user's selected English variant (e.g. "color" vs "colour")?**
_Primer: Clarifies this decision and why it matters._
→ Your answer:

**Answer:** Yes—MindTyper will respect the user's English variant preference (e.g. US, UK, Canadian, Australian) and adapt spelling accordingly.

If a user types "colour," "favour," or "realise," that becomes the default. It won't mix styles unless the user does.

The system will auto-detect preference based on early usage but allow manual override. Once set, it reinforces consistency without making it feel rigid.

---

**122. Should MindTyper automatically localize keyboard-driven symbols (e.g. £ vs $)?**
_Primer: Clarifies this decision and why it matters._
→ Your answer:

**Answer:** Yes—but only when it's clear the user intends localization. If someone types "£" on a UK keyboard or "$" on a US one, MindTyper assumes it's correct and does not override.

However, if a user's writing context suggests another currency or symbol is more appropriate (like switching to USD while working on a US invoice), MindTyper may gently suggest a correction or standardize—but only with very high confidence.

The system will learn symbol preferences over time and subtly guide consistency, not force it.

---

**123. Should MindTyper adjust spacing around non-letter characters (e.g. between emoji, symbols, punctuation)?**
_Primer: Clarifies this decision and why it matters._
→ Your answer:

**Answer:** Yes—MindTyper will gently clean up spacing around non-letter characters when it improves clarity and flow.

For example:

- "hello !" → "hello!"
- "Hi🙂 there" → "Hi 🙂 there"
- "% 50" → "50%"

But it will never touch emoji sequences, code snippets, or stylized formats that are clearly intentional. The goal is to remove friction—not overwrite the user's expressive style.

---

**124. Should MindTyper normalize repeated punctuation or expressive sequences (e.g. "?!!", "...", "!!!")?**
_Primer: Clarifies this decision and why it matters._
→ Your answer:

**Answer:** No—MindTyper will preserve expressive punctuation like "?!!" or "..." when it aligns with the user's tone.

These sequences are often intentional—used for emphasis, emotion, or rhythm—and flattening them would strip personality from the writing.

MindTyper will only normalize if repetition looks accidental or wildly inconsistent. Otherwise, it supports emotional texture as part of the user's voice.

## Implementation Notes

This section establishes MindTyper's approach to:

1. **Privacy-First Personalization**: Cloud sync with user control over data
2. **Tone Intelligence**: Inference without judgment or coaching
3. **Multilingual Flexibility**: Seamless language switching and regional preferences
4. **Context Awareness**: Code-aware processing and emoji preservation
5. **Invisible Enhancement**: No nudging, coaching, or interrupting user flow
6. **Language-Specific Rules**: Layered correction system with general rules (language-agnostic) and language-specific guidance packs (e.g., German noun capitalization, Spanish accents)

### Multilingual Support Framework

MindTyper operates on a layered correction system:

- **General rules**: Language-agnostic principles (spacing, numeric formatting, tone preservation)
- **Language-specific rules**: Grammar, syntax, and style conventions for each supported language
- **English as default base**: Primary development and behavior foundation
- **Western languages priority**: German, Spanish, French, Italian as secondary language packs
- **Context-aware detection**: Language switching based on content context with user override capability
